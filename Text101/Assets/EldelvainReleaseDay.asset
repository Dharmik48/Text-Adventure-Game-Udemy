    Oh shit shit shit!!!! I am LATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JOHN(Teddy\u2019s roommate)
    why did you turn off the alarm today again! I Strictly told you not to mess with
    my ALARM!\u201C. \u201COh come on Ted, '' said John,\u201D it's the weekend and
    you work so hard every day so I thought of letting you have some rest!\u201D.
    Teddy said, \u201CYou know it\u2019s the day Eldelvain\u201D comes out!\u201D.
    \u201CWhy do you worry about that, I mean you work at a bookstore, you won\u2019t
    have to spend your day standing in queues\u201D John said calmly. A bit relieved
    Teddy said, \u201CI mean you have a point but..\u201D. \u201CNO buts\u201D, interrupted
    John, continuing with, \u201CNow come on, make us some breakfast, it\u2019s your
    turn today!\u201D. Teddy straight up refused to make breakfast as a punishment
    for setting off the alarm. Angry John, not ready to make the breakfast, stood
    against the door not allowing Ted to go to the store.\r\n\r\n\tOption 1 - Trick
    John and go to the store.\n\tOption 2 - Make breakfast and then go to the store.\r"
