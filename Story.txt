"The Pass to Eldelvain"


After a long week of part-time work at a bookstore, tired Teddy is very exhilarated as the day of which he was eagerly waiting for is now just a good night’s sleep away! The day when the most awaited, the most hyped Fantasy Novel “Eldelvain” is closing in on the release! But little did he knew that it won’t be just the “release” of the “Eldelvain” for him but something far more..!

Next Morning…. (Eldelvain Release Day)

“Good Morning! Oh shit shit shit!!!! I am LATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JOHN(Teddy’s roommate) why did you turn off the alarm today again! I Strictly told you not to mess with my ALARM!“. “Oh come on Ted, '' said John,” it's the weekend and you work so hard every day so I thought of letting you have some rest!”. Teddy said, “You know it’s the day Eldelvain” comes out!”. “Why do you worry about that, I mean you work at a bookstore, you won’t have to spend your day standing in queues” John said calmly. A bit relieved Teddy said, “I mean you have a point but..”. “NO buts”, interrupted John, continuing with, “Now come on, make us some breakfast, it’s your turn today!”. Teddy straight up refused to make breakfast as a punishment for setting off the alarm. Angry John, not ready to make the breakfast, stood against the door not allowing Ted to go to the store.

	Option 1 - Make breakfast and then go to the store.
	Option 2 - Trick John and go to the store.

----- Option 1 ------

Ted makes John some breakfast and then goes to get Eldelvain. Get’s back home, reads the novel and praises it forever!

**** THE END *****

----- Option 2 ------

Yet to write….
